#cloud-config

# The autoinstall directive and cloud-init have some confusing overlap.
# Perhaps it's correct to say that the autoinstall directive is used 
# to configure the installer, while cloud-init is used to configure the
# installed system.
# In any case, I couldn't find an easy way to enable the ssh server 
# via cloud-init, while autoinstall has a simple key for it.
# Supposedly, the user-data section will be passed along to cloud-init.
